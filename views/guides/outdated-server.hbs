    <h1>VIAaaS (accessing "Outdated Servers")</h1>
    <p>Many users may be familiar with a plugin known as ViaVersion. This plugin allows outdated servers to accept the
      latest game versions that players connect from. This, unfortunately, is not a viable option for a service such
      as the Public GeyserConnect. There is a solution though. We also host an instance of what is known as "VIA As A
      Service" or VIAaaS for short. This is a proxy server that allows version mismatching. Our primary focus is the
      latest version to outdated servers.</p>

    <p>Using this server is more complicated than GeyserConnect is. GeyserConnect has a really nice (subjectively
      speaking) user interface, while VIAaaS has no user interface at all. It instead accepts arguments as part of the
      server address. The server address is `via.geyserconnect.net` but this will not do much by itself. You must pass
      the server and sometimes the version info to it, or enter the information into the login login page. So for
      instance, to connect to 2b2t you must use `2b2t.org._of._v1_12_2.via.geyserconnec.net`. The "2b2t.org" is of
      course the address. the "._of" uses the offline listener in the <a href="https://via-login.geyserconnect.net">web
        auth page for VIAaaS</a> and "._v1_12-2" tells it the server
      is version 1.12.2. This is a fairly confusing (imo) system to use, so join our discord and hop over to the
      <code>#viaaas-help</code> channel for some assistance in getting started.
