  <h1>The easy way to join our server with your console, by using your friends list.</h1>
  <p>Go to your Friends list.</p>
  <p>Select Add Friend.</p>
  <div class="section">
    <p>We have a total of 4 friend listeners (bots). Select one based what you're looking for. You'll type one of
      the following into the gamertag box.</p>
    <p>"Public GC": This is the primary friend bot. It points to whatever server we have geyserconnect.net pointed
      to at whatever time.</p>
    <p>"Public US GC": This is the bot that always points to the U.S. server.</p>
    <p>"Public EU GC": This bot always points to the European server.</p>
    <p>"PublicBetaGC": This bot points to our Experimental server.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Select Add Friend again.</p>
  <p>Wait for our system to add you back as a friend.</p>
  <p>Go to your game's "Friends" tab.</p>
  <p>Look for and select the "US Public GeyserConnect proxy!" entry to join.</p>
  <p>If you need to use the EU or Experimental server, go to the "Official Servers" entry in the GeyserConnect and
    select the one you want to use.</p>
  <p>P.S. You can add/remove us freely with your friends list. Our system will respond in kind automatically. There
    are no limits to number of times this can be done.</p>
  <p>P.P.S. This system is still experimental. Switch and XBox players who are comfortable with changing their
    internet settings are advised to use the "Advanced Setup" as a backup.</p>
